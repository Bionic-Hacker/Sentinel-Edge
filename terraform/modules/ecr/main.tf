# A private image repository. Tags are immutable, so a deployed tag always means the same image
# (deployments also pin the digest). Images are scanned on push; layers are encrypted with the
# platform key. Storage is $0.10/GB-month, so a few images cost cents, and the repository is kept
# between deploy windows.
